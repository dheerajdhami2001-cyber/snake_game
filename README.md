# Snake Game in Python

A classic implementation of the Snake game built using Python and the Turtle graphics library. This project was completed as part of Dr. Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" on Udemy.

## About The Project

This project demonstrates fundamental Python programming and game development concepts. It is structured using object-oriented principles, with separate classes for the Snake, Food, and Scoreboard to manage the game's logic and state.
